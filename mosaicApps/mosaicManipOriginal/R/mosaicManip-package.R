#'
#' Manipulatable applets from Project MOSAIC (mosaic-web.org) used to teach mathematics, 
#' statistics, computation and modeling.  Funded by the NSF, Project MOSAIC is creating a 
#' community of educators working to tie together aspects of quantitative work that students 
#' in science, technology, engineering and mathematics will need in their professional lives, 
#' but which are usually taught in isolation, if at all.
