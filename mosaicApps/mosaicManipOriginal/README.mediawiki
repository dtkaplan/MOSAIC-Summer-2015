=The mosaicManip Package and Project MOSAIC=

==The mosaicManip package==
The mosaicManip package contains functions that take advantage of the manipulate package available
in RStudio to create applets for teaching statistics and calculus, and for manipulating models
and graphs of various sorts.

At the moment, this code will only work in RStudio.

===News===
* 2012-01-24: Project MOSAIC migrates its mosaicManip R package from R-forge to github.  Simultaneously, we are converting to roxygen documentation.  (Wish us luck in the transition.)

==Project MOSAIC==
Project MOSAIC is a community of educators working to develop a new way to
introduce mathematics, statistics, computation and modeling to students in
colleges and universities.

Our goal: Provide a broader approach to quantitative studies that provides
better support for work in science and technology. The focus of the project is
to tie together better diverse aspects of quantitative work that students in
science, technology, and engineering will need in their professional lives, but
which are today usually taught in isolation, if at all.

* Modeling. The ability to create, manipulate and investigate useful and informative mathematical representations of a real-world situations.
* Statistics. The analysis of variability that draws on our ability to quantify uncertainty and to draw logical inferences from observations and experiment.
* Computation. The capacity to think algorithmically, to manage data on large scales, to visualize and interact with models, and to automate tasks for efficiency, accuracy, and reproducibility.
* Calculus. The traditional mathematical entry point for college and university students and a subject that still has the potential to provide important insights to today's students.

The name MOSAIC reflects the first letters --- M, S, C, C --- of these
important components of a quantitative education. Project MOSAIC is motivated
by a vision of quantitative education as a mosaic where the basic materials
come together to form a complete and compelling picture.
