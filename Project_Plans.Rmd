## Project Description

The purpose of Project MOSAIC (NSF DUE-0920350) is to help unify instruction in statistics and calculus, integrating them with modeling and computation.

The work in Summer 2015 has two main objectives:

1. Design and develop error handlers and graphical user interfaces that will help students construct correct commands, warn them when they are not, and suggest changes.
2. Work with faculty from the ACM data-science group and the Consortium for Visualization and Computation to put their research case studies in a form that can readily be used by students. This will include participation in the CVC meeting at Smith College in mid-July, and pre-meeting planning with participants and post-meeting follow-up with them.

The summer's work should familiarize the students with core elements of data science. Technologies that will be used include R, Shiny, GitHub, RMarkdown, and data-science packages such as `dplyr` and `ggplot2`.
