```{r}
library(mosaicMapShapes)
library(ggplot2)
```

You can get a listing of the available shapefiles.
```{r}
list_shapefiles()$name
```

There are two data tables associated with each name, one called 
* `[name]_shapes` the shapefile itself.  The entity identifier is always named `id`.
* `[name]_data` which contains information about the entities themselves.  Often, you can use this to merge in a more descriptive identifier (e.g. country names) and it often contains information about other codes used for that identifier. 

The shapefiles are ready for plotting, e.g.

```{r out.width="100%", dpi=500}
ggplot(World_rivers_shapes, aes(x=long, y=lat, group=group)) +
  geom_path(color="blue") + 
  geom_path(data=World_shapes)
```
